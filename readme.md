# Evaluate
## Decide what you really want to do.

A wildly simple web app to help you pick an activity that's free (or at least inexpensive), and maybe inspire you to invite a friend.

Built as an exercise in node, hapi, React, ES6/ES2015 and eventually maybe mongo. I'm aware that this could easily be done without React, and perhaps React isn't the best choice anyway, but I need to learn it somehow, right? :)

### Use

If you want to play around, I'll post this to Heroku as soon as I come up with a good amount of seed items

### Use locally

If you'd prefer to do this on your own machine, here's what you do.

* ```npm install```
* ```node app.js```


### Backlog
I've got a few other items in my backlog to integrate into the project if I find some time. The top of the list is setting up an endpoint to share specific activities with others.
