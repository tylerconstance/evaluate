# Evaluate
## Decide what you really want to do.

A wildly simple web app to help you pick an activity that's free (or at least inexpensive), and maybe inspire you to invite a friend.

Built as an exercise in node, hapi, React, and eventually maybe mongo. I'm aware that this could easily be done without React, and perhaps React isn't the best choice anyway, but I need to learn it somehow, right? :)

### Use

If you want to play around, this *should* be on heroku by the time you read this, but hey, maybe I forgot.

### Use locally

If you'd prefer to do this on your own machine, here's what you do.

* ```npm install```
* ```node app.js```
